Hey there! 👋
This is a simple fake API I made for practicing, testing, and just messing around with frontend stuff.

🚀 What It Does
Pretends to be a real API

Lets you GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data

Sends back nice, clean JSON

Super easy to tweak if you wanna add more stuff

📦 How to Run It

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Saeed-Ali-1/Local-API.git

Install stuff (if needed):

bash
Copy
Edit

Fire it up:

Start making requests at:

Use Postman, your browser, or even your own frontend app — whatever you like! 🎯

🧩 Endpoints

Method	URL	What It Does
GET	/users	Grab all users
GET	/users/{id}	Grab a single user

PUT	/users/{id}	Update a user’s info

✅ Easy to add more if you need!

🎯 Example Response

{
  "id": 1,

🤔 Why?
Because sometimes you just need a fake backend to make your frontend dreams come true. 🌈
